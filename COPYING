For each file distributed within the software, we tried to include an 
appropriate copyright documentation pointing to the license applied in 
every case. Whether the license information is incomplete or missing, AGPLv3 
will be considered a default unless this file states otherwise.

If we included by mistake any software that is non-free or depends on non free
software, please send us a notice (see AUTHORS file) in order to fix the 
situation (or just use one of the ITSs specified via CONTRIBUTING file).
