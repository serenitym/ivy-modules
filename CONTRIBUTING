This software is developed using the following technologies:

* PHP 5.3+
* MySQL / MariaDB

* YAML

In order to contribute to Ivy Framework project (and its subprojects), 
you need to meet the following technical requirements:

* a reasonable understanding of how Git works
* PHP 5.3 (still supported until Q3-Q4 of 2014)
* MySQL / MariaDB syntax
* JavaScript and jQuery
* knowledge about asynchronous server requests
* ability to respect a coding style

For the coding style itself, check the STYLE file.


The project is hosted on GitHub and it is mirrored at its previous location, 
which is a private GitLab instance we used in the very early stages.

We also have a Redmine [1] instance ready for it, which handles issue tracking,
planning and other organizational stuff.

Continuous integration and build system is done via Travis [2], which needs to 
be properly configured in order to see some real data. We'll try to make it 
possible soon.

At the moment, we don't have a proper webpage for the project itself, which 
is waiting for a small refactoring and module break-down. After that, we'll 
start by generation Apigen [3] documentation and publishing it somewhere.

We'll update this file whenever something new comes into our workflow.
